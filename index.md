# Cybersecurity Automation Workshop

```markdown
**Under Construction**

```

The next Cybersecurity Automation Workshop
will be held 2-June-2022 at the
[AT&T Forum](https://policyforum.att.com/att-forum/)
in Washington, DC.

## Agenda
Schedule is tentatively 9AM-5PM 2-June-2022;
details are still being worked.

Feedback from the last workshop recommended spreading the
keynotes throughout the day
(last time they were all in the kickoff session).
Although a detailed agenda still needs to be created,
the intent will be spread out the keynotes as recommended.

## Venue
The [AT&T Forum](https://policyforum.att.com/att-forum/)
is located at 601 New Jersey Avenue NW, Washington, DC 20001.

## Remote Access
Intent is to allow virtual participation.
It may not apply to all sessions or all interoperation demonstrations.

## Eligibility
Open to all.


## Registration
Participation will require registration.
Details forthcoming.

## Participating Organizations
Strictly speaking none
(ie workshop is a collection of individuals
getting together to understand and get stuff interoperating
for the common good).

But the individuals will be (potentially?)
bringing together the work of the following:
- PACE
- [OpenC2](openc2.org)
-

To learn more how the work of these organizations
will be specifically used in this workshop,
see the following subtending pages:
- PACE
- OpenC2

## Objective, Goals, Focus
Still early in planning stages so this needs work


Attendees should walk away feeling
that they have had a positive engagement
with their peers
and have more confidence
cybersecurity automation
is in a better state.


## Governance
This workshop is being organized by one passionate individual volunteer
who was unelected and will be running it on the
D-cubed model (Duncan/democratic/dictator).

## Code of Conduct
TL;DR - don't be a jerk.

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment,
we as organizers and participants
pledge to making participation in our projects and our community
a harassment-free experience for everyone,
regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity,
sex characteristics, gender identity and expression,
level of experience, education, socio-economic status,
nationality, personal appearance, race, religion,
or sexual identity and orientation.
