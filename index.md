# Cybersecurity Automation Workshop

```markdown
**Under Construction**

```

The next Cybersecurity Automation Workshop
will be held 2-June-2022 at the
[AT&T Forum](https://policyforum.att.com/att-forum/)
in Washington, DC.

## Agenda
Schedule is tentatively 9AM-5PM 2-June-2022;
details are still being worked.

Feedback from the last workshop recommended spreading the
keynotes throughout the day
(last time they were all in the kickoff session).
Although a detailed agenda still needs to be created,
the intent will be spread out the keynotes as recommended.

See [Agenda](./Agenda.md) for more details.

## Venue
The [AT&T Forum](https://policyforum.att.com/att-forum/)
is located at 601 New Jersey Avenue NW, Washington, DC 20001.

Thank you to AT&T for hosting the event for us.

## Remote Access
Intent is to allow virtual participation.
It may not apply to all sessions or all interoperation demonstrations.

Details need to be worked out yet.

## Keynotes
keynote speakers have been lined up.
Eventually add them here or make a subtending page.

## Eligibility
Open to all.
Free.
Registration will be required.

Should we reach limits (if any)
on the number of physical attendees,
some sort of rules will need to be worked out,
well in advance,
on who is eligible to attend.
Rules would probably
be based on sweat equity, distance traveled,
and a quota (ie to spread attendance across the orgs involved).


## Registration
Participation will require registration.
Details forthcoming.

## Participating Organizations
Strictly speaking none
(ie workshop is a collection of individuals
getting together to understand and get stuff interoperating
for the common good).

But the individuals will be (potentially?)
bringing together the work of the following:
- [PACE](https://github.com/opencybersecurityalliance/PACE)
- [OpenC2](openc2.org)
- TAC
- CACAO
- SBOM
- LF SPDX
- OWASP CycloneDX
- CASF

the above committed. add the others as they commit or now?
- CTI/STIX/TAXII
- LF Daggerboard
- OCA Ontology
- OCA stixshifter
- OCA Kestrel
- IETF MUD
- ...

will be specifically used in this workshop,
